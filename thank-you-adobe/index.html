                    Dear Ms. Keith, <br><br>
                        It has been an honor having you as a speaker in our 2020 ENGR001 class. We thoroughly enjoyed the lessons you taught us and the motivation you instilled into us. We think that your talk helped prepare us a bit more for the future because we now know a little bit more of what to expect when we get an internship or job and also how to better prepare for that. We hope you will have a great rest of the year!!

                            Upon reading about your work at Adobe, we were really impressed. We thought it would be a great idea to add it here as part of our memoir to what you have accomplished, as well as to remind ourselves that we can make it in industry. Growing up, we've all utilized Adobe products. We've read pdfs, drawn beautiful imagery, and edited memorable photos. Thus, it was pleasant to hear that a UCR alumni took part in what will be many people's normal every day life. The impact that these applications have on our daily lives is tremendous.

                            Sizable programming projects often require huge teams of individuals working together to achieve a common goal. Adobe Fresco is one of those projects, and your leadership is commendable. In particular, creating a library that an entire application will use going forward really resonated with us. I can imagine myself attempting a difficult project and running into a library that makes my life easier. With that thought in mind, the work that goes into making a library must be arduous. Thus, we are extremely impressed with this.
                            Further, we understand the sheer amount of effort and discipline it takes to run a team. Your team leadership skills that you've demonstrated while working on Adobe Fresco is what we deem to be the epitemy of hard work and sheer accomplishment.

                           I personally really love adobe sketch! I love all the adobe products and I believe they make my life a lot more interesting and fun because I can use them to edit pdfs, paint digitally, and also edit and create interesting pieces of media art. Adobe sketch is really great for art and makes what I love to do as a hobby a lot more fun and interesting.

                            In coming to UCR, I felt imposter syndrome and believed that I did not belong in the field, as everyone seemed smarter than me. I often doubted myself and tried extra hard in everything in order to convince myself of my worth. But, in listening to your talk, I "clicked", and now I'm continually trying to improve for the right reasons. I am now more than ever convinced that I want to pursue a career in computer science, and thanks to you I'm no longer doubting myself. Thank you!

                            I really loved your talk since it covered a lot of things I have been thinking about recently. I personally found your talk really encouraging and somewhat inspirational because I myself went into computer science not really knowing anything other than that I like to code. I really liked how you touched on how you don't always have to know what you're going to do in the future since that has been something I've been really worried about.
