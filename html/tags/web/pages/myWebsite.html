            <h2>Making a Website</h2>
			<p>
                This article is more about my experience with making websites, rather than just talking about how to actually make a website. However, I may talk a little bit about how I fixed some simple issues or the like. Anyways, thank you for visiting my site and I hope you'll enjoy this article... even though the majority is just me rambling XD

                When it comes to making a personal website, making one from scratch is not always ideal. However, it can be a fun, educational, and also challenging project. Making a website can be difficult, especially if you have never really payed attention to what goes into making a website possible. But, despite that I highly recommend at least trying it out. Who knows, maybe you'll really like it.   
            </p>
            <p>
                I've wanted to maked a website for a couple of years, but I was never satisfied with any of my attempts. I could have used a template or one of the many website platforms such as wordpress, wix, and squarespace. I could have even just used bootstrap or maybe jekyll (as github pages suggests I use lol) when developing my site, but I really, <i>really</i> wanted to try making a site the old fashioned way... so using only HTML, CSS, and JS. However, that is a really difficult task...  if what you're aiming for is a nice looking website with almost zero prior experience with web development.  
            </p>
            <p>
                In my first couple of attempts I would just put random things together, hoping it would work. When I first started, I didn't know what a container was, I didn't know how to link style sheets (that's still difficult for me lol), and I didn't even know how to center text or images. My only goal was to make a website that looked a bit similar to a blog. Essentially I wanted a white square in the middle of the page ontop of some sort of background, with a navbar at the top. Everything else was secondary to me, however I didn't even know where to start. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I first started off with the HTML and CSS course on Code Academy. I didn't have pro (and I still don't) so I couldn't complete all the lessons, but I think that was a good start for me. After that I somewhat understood what I could do with HTML and I sort of understood what CSS did. I thought to myself, how hard can this be? 
            </p>
            <p> 
                Well... first off I realized I really didn't know how to link a style sheet and I just couldn't figure out how to get it to link correctly. I was getting really frustrated because the link just wouldn't work, so I decided I'm just going to try something else lol. You might be thinking, how were you not able to figure out how to link a style sheet to your html file? Well, for one I believe the issue was with me not understanding how file directories work. I never really understood how file directories worked until I got into high school and spent some time learning how to set up linux. Back then I also had a limited amount of time I was allowed to be on the computer, so I'd often read a little bit about something like how to style text, spend a couple minutes fiddling with tags and whoops, it's already been an hour? And so I wouldn't really get much progress done in a day.  
            </p>
            <p>
                But back to the stylesheets. I think it's a good thing to know when you can give up. If it doesn't work the first time, try again. But if it doesn't work even after a couple of hours, maybe you should give it some time and come back to the issue when you're less stressed and agitated. And so I did that... and my first website html was littered with style tags lol. The text also wasn't in any sort of container so it spanned the entire length of the browser. And although I managed to make a background, I couldn't figure out how to get the text background to be different from the rest of the body. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But even though it looked extremely ugly, I felt felt proud of the fact that it was something I made. But I suppose a website is like a drawing. Once you compare your drawing to someone else's, you start to think I'm really bad at this. My drawing is so much worse. But as a first attempt, it was probably decent... probably. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I probably spent anywhere from a week to a month on that website (with sporatic hours due to my limited computer time... I mean who can resist the desire to play games for that long lol). I didn't spend that much time on that site, and it shows. But I did learn some of the basics for website development and the next time that I attempted making a website, I knew a little bit more about what I should be doing.  
            </p>
            <p> 
                The next time I tried making a website, I was able to link a style sheet to my html. But there were some issues with that. For one, I was (and still am) unable to fully understand how htlm works. And two, my only use of css was when I was following a tutorial and trying to synthesize everything that I learned into one html file and stylesheet led to some very... ugly websites. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't really understand how classes and attributes work. I've gotten a little bit better, and I now know how to modify my CSS stylesheets and HTML sheets accordingly, but back then I really, really did not understand how they worked. After figuring out how to link a stylesheet to my html, I tried fixing the layout of my website. I looked at the w3schools site on how to make a website layout, but I really didn't know how it worked even after looking at every individual piece of the code on their provided template.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point I tried piecing a bunch of things together (I still do this lol) and fixing all of the issues that appeared due to conflicting styles. However, as I really didn't understand classes or how CSS works in general, I couldn't really fix anything. By now I had figured out how to make a container, but it wasn't really pretty. And it definitely was not responsive. I can't remember anymore if I had tried messing around with flexbox around this time, but it's likely I didn't as I was really against using things that weren't what I considered "pure" HTML or CSS. I really don't know what got that into my head, but even now I'm still a bit like that. I don't want to use a template because I want to try doing things from scratch and I want to figure out how you can achieve the same result using HTML and CSS before moving on to something that's "easier". 
            </p>
            <p>
                This logic is obviously a bit flawed, but it has at the very least helped me develop my skills. I'm still not exactly a pro and I definitely can't write everything out on how to develop a website without looking at documentation, but I think now I understand a bit better on how HTML and CSS work together. Javascript is still a bit difficult for me to understand. I can look at the code and understand how it works, but I can't write that code or even really modify it. I think part of that reason is likely because I've never thought about using it before. I haven't tried making a function that would let me access a page by clicking a button, but I think like with CSS and HTML, the longer I spend working with it, the more I'll learn. And eventually, I might be able to understand it. :) 
            </p>
            <p>
                Well anyways, going back to flexbox. I had a lot of issues with flexbox. Most noticably, once I got a working navbar, adding in flexbox added a little line between the navbar and the top of the website. I only recently realized that this was caused by flexbox and can be fixed by setting the margin to 0 in whatever container the navbar is contained in. In my case, the navbar is located in the body and as such the body left margin is set to zero (because my navbar is on the left of the website). I've found the chrome web developer tools really useful for finding the cause of small issues in my website. It's helped me find a number of small issues in my code from accidentally forgetting to erase an > from a comment, to figuring out how to center something.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Having multiple stylesheets is important, however it can also lead to issues if your naming is vague or if you forget how to link to the stylesheet location. As such, organization is really important when it comes to web development. Before you start developing a website, you should ask yourself "Why do I want to make a website", "What exactly do I want?", "How can I acheive my desired goal?", "What content do I want to put in my website", and "Who is my audience?". You don't have to have all of the above answered when you first start off with developing a website, but it does help. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As you add in features to your website, try and think about those questions. Your answers will likely change as you more features, however try to always keep the end goal in mind and ask yourself, "Why do I want to make a website?". If it gets too difficult and you want to give up, remember you don't have to make a website from scratch. There are plenty of perfectly usable templates that look amazing. There are literally hundreds of different options you can take when it comes to making a personal site. If it gets too difficult, maybe take a short break. You can always come back.    
            </p>
            <p>
                Some things I've found that helped with both inspiration and motivation, is to have a small list of ideas that I can later turn into posts later on. I'll jot down a few notes on that topic so later I'll know what I can write about. Another thing I do is to bookmark websites that I really like. For example, if I find a navbar that I really like from a specific website, I bookmark it so I can use it as reference for my own site. If you see a feature you really like, try checking the source code of the website and reading the html and css stylesheets. It's highly likely they used a theme so there won't be much code that you understand, but maybe you'll be able figure out how that navbar was created. XD
            </p>
            <p>
                Something that I do (that isn't exactly limited to just web development) is to keep a pencil and some paper next to be when I go to bed. Because usually right before I fall asleep I'll think of some sort of idea that I want to look into, but I'll forget it the next day. So before I actually fall asleep, I'll quickly write down what ever it is that I was thinking of. Half the time it's on a topic I need to review for schoolwork, but sometimes it's something like, "look up how to open another page in an iframe" or "fix the home page so it works on mobile devices". 
            </p>
            <p>
                Planning a website is difficult, especially when you don't know what content you want to publish. However, if you're just starting out, I strongly suggest
